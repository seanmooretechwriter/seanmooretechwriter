- ‚ö° Fun fact: I started working with web development in the late '90s and have watched the evolution of the web happen ever since!

Throughout my career, I've functioned as a web & desktop developer, technical writer & reviewer, technical editor, graphic & UI designer, and journalist. I've written on topics ranging from web development to crypto and Web3 to lakes and digital audio production. Some publishers I've had the privilege and honor of working with include O'Reilly Media, Addison-Wesley, Pearson VUE, Adobe, Cointelegraph, Packt Publishing, and Manning.

Some companies I've had the utmost privilege and honor of working with include Adobe, Disney, Microsoft, Warner Bros., T-Mobile, and 2Advanced.

In years gone by, I served as an Adobe Community Professional and was once an Adobe Flex Developer Champion. I'm also a certified ActionScript 1.0 and Flex Developer, even though those technologies are long gone and forgotten. My time working closely with Macromedia/Adobe Flash, ActionScript, and Flex formed the base for a deep love, appreciation, and understanding of application development. The similarities between modern Vue 3 and TypeScript compared to Flex and ActionScript 3.0 continue to astound me daily.

I'm the creator/author of the original ActionScript Cheatsheets. If you were a developer around 2006-2012 you more than likely saw the AS Cheatsheets or maybe even got a laminated one from me at a conference. You can see the original AS 2.0 version here: https://web.archive.org/web/20060207203712im_/http://www.actionscriptcheatsheet.com/actionscript_cheat_sheet.jpg

My first serious web development job was with the now-gone Mortgage101.com. The web application was originally written in Active Server Pages (ASP) and backed by MSSQL Server. I worked with the organization through the dot-com boom and learned a lot during my nearly five years with the company. This was back in the pre-cloud days when our in-house servers often went down due to high volume traffic. This caused the support phone lines to light up like Christmas. Chaos ensued throughout the small company until sanity was restored. I believe the CTO once went to Best Buy in the middle of the day and purchased a computer to set up as a temporary server. Oh, the good 'ol days...

Around the turn of the century, when I worked on the Mortgage101 web application (written in classic ASP), I saw firsthand how a large codebase can grow quickly and beyond control. The code was very brittle and difficult to navigate and understand. Making changes would often disrupt service and break other areas of the application (tightly coupled with low cohesion). That experience drove me to learn about and embrace best practices and coding standards. I have consulted many individual developers, teams, and companies on how they can adopt and embrace better practices and coding standards for their development efforts and initiatives. Through my experience working with many different codebases, I've seen the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful, and the horrific. If I've learned anything, there is no such thing as a perfect codebase or perfect code, and chasing it is a fool's errand. 

I worked with Adobe's Consulting division for several years and learned even more there. At one point, I worked on the largest project the consulting division had ever undertaken. Over seventy developers were working together on a multi-billion dollar project for one of the largest companies in the world. By the end of the project, a small team remained, including me and several other world-class engineers. I learned so much during my time with Adobe and on that project specifically. Some lessons I learned there have carried with me for over a decade. The tier of engineers and technical architects I had the privilege to work with amazes me to this day. Clean Code was required reading for developers, and TDD was "implied," meaning you were expected to commit tests with all the code you wrote.

Test driven development (TDD), development best practices, and coding standards are the foundation for a well rounded and sane development experience and have thus been a major focus throughout my career and life. I've written about and given presentations at conferences and user groups on these topics to share what I and many others have learned the hard way. 

After working with programming languages and code for over two decades, I've discovered that simplicity is far superior to complexity, and deleting code is generally better than pouring on additional code. To quote the great Einstein: "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius --- and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."
