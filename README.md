- ⚡ Fun fact: I started working with web development in the late '90s and have watched the evolution of the web happen ever since!

Throughout my career, I've functioned as a web & desktop developer, technical writer & reviewer, technical editor, graphic & UI designer, and journalist. I've written on topics ranging from web development to crypto and Web3 to lakes and digital audio production. Some publishers I've had the privilege and honor of working with include O'Reilly Media, Addison-Wesley, Pearson VUE, Adobe, Cointelegraph, Packt Publishing, and Manning.

Some companies I've had the utmost privilege and honor of working with include Adobe, Disney, Microsoft, Warner Bros., T-Mobile, and 2Advanced.

In years gone by, I served as an Adobe Community Professional and was once an Adobe Flex Developer Champion. I'm also a certified ActionScript 1.0 and Flex Developer, even though those technologies are long gone and forgotten. My time working closely with Macromedia/Adobe Flash, ActionScript, and Flex formed the base for a deep love, appreciation, and understanding of application development. The similarities between modern Vue 3 and TypeScript compared to Flex and ActionScript 3.0 continue to astound me daily.

I'm the creator/author of the original ActionScript Cheatsheets. If you were a developer around 2006-2012 you more than likely saw the AS Cheatsheets or maybe even got a laminated one from me at a conference. You can see the original AS 2.0 version here: https://web.archive.org/web/20060207203712im_/http://www.actionscriptcheatsheet.com/actionscript_cheat_sheet.jpg

Test driven development (TDD), development best practices, and coding standards are the foundation for a well rounded and sane development experience and have thus been a major focus throughout my career and life. I've written about and given presentations at conferences and user groups on these topics to share what I and many others have learned the hard way.
